# Getting Started with DEMODOS

This guide will help you set up and run your first simulation.

## Step 1: Setup

To begin using DEMODOS, you need to set up the hardware components:

1. **Server Setup**: Plug the server box with power source into a power socket. The server acts as the central control point and will establish a Wi-Fi network for all devices.
2. **Detectors Setup**: Prepare the PAD (Personal Dosimeter Units) and DDU (Dosimeter Display Units). Ensure each detector is fully charged and operational. Refer to the [charging guide](charging_guide.md) for more details.
3. **Control Device**: Use a notebook, tablet, or similar device to access the control interface through a web browser.

## Step 2: Basic Configuration

Once the system is set up, you can configure your experiment:

1. **Connect to the Server**: Using your control device, connect to the server's Wi-Fi network.
2. **Access the Control Interface**: Open a web browser and navigate to the [https://demodos.lan/](https://demodos.lan/). The control interface will allow you to manage detectors and monitor the simulation.
3. **Detector Configuration**: Assign each detector a unique identifier, and verify that all PAD and DDU units are correctly linked.
4. **Scenario Setup**: Configure the dose rate values, group detectors if needed, and adjust other parameters to match your training scenario.

## Step 3: Running a Simulation

Once everything is set up, the simulation will start automatically when the server is powered on and the PAD and DDU units are connected to the server. The synchronization of time and the display of current values indicate that the simulation is running.

If you need to start a new simulation or begin at a specific time, you can initiate it by resetting the values through the control interface.

1. **Monitor Detector Readings**: Observe the real-time data from PAD and DDU units. The control portal will display the current status and dose rate of each unit.
2. **Adjust and Experiment**: Experiment with different dose rates, simulate random value fluctuations, and practice managing radiation exposure in a controlled environment.

## Tips for Successful Operation

- **Stable Connection**: It is important to remain within the Wi-Fi network's range to ensure all components stay connected for continuous operation.
- **Data Reset**: Use the control interface to reset historical data between simulations for a clean start.
