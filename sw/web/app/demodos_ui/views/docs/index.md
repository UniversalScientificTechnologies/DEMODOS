# Welcome to the DEMODOS Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the DEMODOS system, designed for simulating crew radiation load in training and mission scenarios. The system is flexible, user-friendly, and enables precise control and visualization of simulated radiation exposure.

## What is DEMODOS?

DEMODOS is a simulation tool aimed at replicating radiation exposure in training environments and mission preparation. It is built to provide trainees and operators with a realistic approximation of how radiation might impact different operational conditions. This tool serves both as an educational aid and a critical component in evaluating the effects of radiation in controlled environments.

## How Does It Work?

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Detectors**: Each detector represents a simulated dosimeter set, with unique configurations that can be adjusted to suit various scenarios. The detectors are categorized into two types:
   - **PAD (Personal Dosimeter Unit)**: Represents a personal radiation dosimeter that simulates individual crew exposure.
   - **DDU (Dosimetr Display Unit)**: Provides a display interface for monitoring radiation levels across multiple dosimeters.
2. **Server with Wi-Fi access point**: Acts as the central control point for the entire experiment, managing data flow and connectivity between all components.
3. **Control Interface**: This is accessible via a device (such as a notebook or tablet) connected to the network, providing a real-time overview of dose levels, detector statuses, and summaries.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Dose rate values for individual detectors can be adjusted using sliders, providing hands-on interaction for training purposes.
- **Group Management**: Detectors can be grouped, making it simpler to control multiple units under a single scenario.

## Getting Started

To get started with DEMODOS, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Begin by setting up the system.
2. **Basic Configuration**: Learn how to configure detectors and groups to match your training scenarios.
3. **Running a Simulation**: Access the control interface to start adjusting dose levels and visualizing real-time data.
