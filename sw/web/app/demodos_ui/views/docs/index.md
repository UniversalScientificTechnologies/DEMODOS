# Welcome to the DEMODOS Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the DEMODOS system, designed for simulating crew radiation load in training and mission scenarios. The system is flexible, user-friendly, and enables precise control and visualization of simulated radiation exposure.

## What is DEMODOS?


## How Does It Work?

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Detectors**: Each detector represents a simulated dosimeter, with unique configurations.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: The system offers a clear overview of all detectors and their current status.
- **Interactive Controls**: Dose values for individual detectors can be adjusted using sliders.
- **Automation**: Random value generation simulates dynamic environmental changes.
